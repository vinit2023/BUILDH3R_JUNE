# Instructions - Send & Receive

The following code example will show you how to send, receive and verify the receival of messages using teleporter and foundry. It includes instructions for the [local network](#local-network) and [fuji testnet](#fuji-testnet).

## Local Network

For convenience the private key `56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027` of the default airdrop address is stored in the environment variable `$PK`. Furthermore, the RPC-url for the C-Chain of your local network is set in the `foundry.toml` file.

### Setting the Blockchain ID in the Contracts

Make sure to replace the blockchainID in the sender contract `src/0-send-receive/senderOnCChain.sol` with the ID of your Subnet's blockchain.

> :no_entry_sign: blockchainID of Subnet â‰  chainID of Subnet

You can find the blockchainID of your Subnet with this command:

```bash
avalanche subnet describe mysubnet
```

Take the HEX blockchain ID and replace it sender contract:

```solidity
teleporterMessenger.sendCrossChainMessage(
    TeleporterMessageInput({
        // Replace with blockchainID of your Subnet (see instructions in Readme)
        destinationBlockchainID: 0x92756d698399805f0088fc07fc42af47c67e1d38c576667ac6c7031b8df05293,
        destinationAddress: destinationAddress,
        
        // ...
    })
);
```

### Deploying the Contracts

After adapting the contracts you can deploy them with `forge create`:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK src/0-send-receive/senderOnCChain.sol:SenderOnCChain

```

```bash
forge create --rpc-url mysubnet --private-key $PK src/0-send-receive/receiverOnSubnet.sol:ReceiverOnSubnet
```

### Sending a Message

You can find `<sender_contract_address>` in the output of the first and the `<receiver_contract_address>` of the second `forge create` command in the line saying `Deployed to:`.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK <sender_contract_address> "sendMessage(address,string)" <receiver_contract_address> "Hello"
```

### Verifying Message Receipt

```bash
cast call --rpc-url mysubnet <receiver_contract_address> "lastMessage()(string)"
```

## Fuji Testnet

### Creating a Wallet

For deploying on testnet, we cannot use the airdrop wallet, since the private key is commonly known. To create a new wallet that is stored in a keystore, issue the following command. It will prompt you to secure the private key with a password.

```bash
cast wallet new .
```

You should now see a new Keystore in the root of your project looking something like this `c3832921-d2e6-4d9a-ba6f-017a37b12571`. Rename this file to `keystore`. For easier use of the keystore we already configured a envorinment variable called `KEYSTORE` pointing to the `keystore` file in the working directory.

You can use the wallet stored in the keystore by adding the `--keystore` flag instead of the `--private-key` flag.

```bash
cast wallet address --keystore $KEYSTORE
```

### Funding your Wallet with Fuji Tokens

Head to the [Avalanche Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) and fund your keystore address with Fuji AVAX and Dispatch tokens. Use the coupon code `avalanche-academy`.

### Setting the Blockchain ID in the Contracts on Fuji

Make sure to adapt the destinationBlockchainID of your sending contracts to use the blockchain IDs of the Fuji network:

| Chain | Blockchain ID |
|-------|---------------|
| Fuji C-Chain | 0x7fc93d85c6d62c5b2ac0b519c87010ea5294012d1e407030d6acd0021cac10d5 |
| Dispatch | 0x9f3be606497285d0ffbb5ac9ba24aa60346a9b1812479ed66cb329f394a4b1c7 |

### Deploying the Contracts

After adapting the contracts you can deploy them using your keystore wallet:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url fuji-c --keystore $KEYSTORE src/0-send-receive/senderOnCChain.sol:SenderOnCChain
```

```
forge create --rpc-url dispatch --keystore $KEYSTORE src/0-send-receive/receiverOnSubnet.sol:ReceiverOnSubnet

```

### Sending a Message

```bash
cast send --rpc-url fuji-c --keystore $KEYSTORE <sender_contract_address> "sendMessage(address,string)" <receiver_contract_address> "Hello"
```

### Verifying Message Receipt

```bash
cast call --rpc-url dispatch <receiver_contract_address> "lastMessage()(string)"
```
