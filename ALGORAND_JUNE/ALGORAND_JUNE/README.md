# The all in one Algorand Codespace
The all in one Algorand Codespace allows you to set up a virtual enviroment with the latest developer tooling to interact with the Algorand blockchain. This includes SDKs like Python to code without smart contracts, and the algokit experience for when you want to practise smart contracts and dApps! 

# How to start a codespace?
Above the files in the top right corner you will see a green code button

Once pressed you can start a new codespace by clicking the "Create codespace on main"

# How do I enter an old codespace?
Once you are in the codespace menu (by clicking the green code button) you will see any old code spaces that are still available underneath the create codespace on main button.

# How to use the all in one Algorand Codespace?
1: Once your codespace is fully loaded in run the commmand 'sh algorand_setup.sh' in your terminal

2: After this you can begin coding in your main.py file to practise interacting with the blockchain (no smart contract needed!)

3: To get started with smart contracts/dapps run the command 'algokit init' to initialise your Algorand project.

And thats it! - the rest is your playground. 

Not sure where to start? This codespace is intended for beginner workshops you can find the code we run through in these workshops here:

# Enjoying the Blockchain Developer experience on Algorand?
Then its time to move away from virtual codespace enviroments to local enviroments. Please check out the Algorand Developer Docs to find out how to set up your local enviroment (Its easy and takes less then 10 minutes!)
